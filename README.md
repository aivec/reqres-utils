# Aivec request and response utilies

This package is best used in conjunction with our PHP composer package [wordpress-router](https://github.com/aivec/wordpress-router) and the NPM package [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), an alternative to `fetch`.

For info/error message building, use our PHP composer package [response-handler](https://github.com/aivec/response-handler)
